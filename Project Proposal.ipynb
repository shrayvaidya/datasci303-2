In order for our model to be accurate, the coefficients on the rankings variable and the acceptance rates variable must be statistically significant at an alpha value of 0.05. While we will test other variables, these are the variables that are most important to the stakeholders because they are the metrics that receive the most attention and grant universities prestige. We will also look at F-statistics and probability of F-statistics for model's overall significance (at 0.05 level). The RMSE for our model will also be much smaller than trivial models. Thus, our stakeholders will be able to use our model to see how much university will spend."
