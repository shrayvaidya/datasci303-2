We manully selected 54 predictors from the College Scorecard data set and added them for the institutions ranked in Kaggle. To minimize the presence of missing values in relevant variables, we prioritized data from College Scorecard and filled in missing values using the Kaggle dataset for variables that were common between both datasets, such as sat_avg. Furthermore, to avoid multicollinearity and improve the model's predictions, we removed duplicate columns that measured ranking."
